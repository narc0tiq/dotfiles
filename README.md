This is my public set of dotfiles, or .files, that should be synced up between
all my systems. You're welcome to grab stuff if it looks good, but I doubt
there's anything earth-shattering in here.

The format of this repository is a "castle", as defined by both [Homesick][hs]
and [Homeshick][hsh]. I'm using it with the latter, but either one will
probably work.
